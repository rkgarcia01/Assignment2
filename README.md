#The link to download the repository is attached above and the application should be compatible with Windows 10 OS and up. Click the greed “Code” button on the right side of the screen and click “Download ZIP”. You can transfer it to your desktop folder afterward or place it wherever you want it. Once doing so go to your CLI and go to this folder and activate the virtual environment. You can do this by typing "source .venv/bin/activate". It will have the latest version of python installed and then you can type in "python Assignment2.py" to run the program. To run the test functions, you can do so by typing in "pytest test_Assignment2.py". Both python (*.py) files should work if downloaded correctly.
